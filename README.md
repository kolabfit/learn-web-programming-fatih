## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is a markup language used for creating the structure and presenting the content of web pages. It provides a set of elements and tags that define the different components and layout of a webpage. HTML serves as the foundation for organizing and displaying text, images, links, multimedia, and other elements on the internet.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and visual appearance of HTML documents. It enables web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of multiple web pages from a single CSS file. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), developers can create consistent and visually appealing websites.

## HTML5
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, introducing new elements, attributes, and APIs that enhance web development capabilities. It incorporates features like audio and video playback, canvas for graphics, geolocation, local storage, and improved semantic elements. HTML5 empowers developers to create more interactive and multimedia-rich websites and applications.

## CSS3
CSS3 is the latest version of CSS, introducing new features, selectors, and properties for styling and layout control. It brings advanced techniques such as transitions, animations, gradients, shadows, and flexible box layout (Flexbox) and grid layout (CSS Grid). CSS3 allows developers to create dynamic, visually appealing, and responsive designs for modern web pages.

This repository serves as a starting point for learning and practicing web development fundamentals. It provides code examples, resources, and exercises to help you understand and apply HTML, CSS, HTML5, and CSS3 in your web projects.
